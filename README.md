This will be (but is not yet) a support framework suitable for including in
Mac OS X apps that will allow users to submit several pieces of information
from within the app when they are having trouble. This includes:

 * Crash reports
 * Console logs
 * Preferences
 * The current document
 * System information
 * Problem description

This is a fork of the excellent [FeedbackReporter framework][1] which already
did most of what we were looking for. There are some things we'd rather do
differently though, which was the reason for this fork.
